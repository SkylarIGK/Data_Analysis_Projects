# Largest Companies in US Analysis
## Introduction
This is a U.S. Top 100 Companies Data Analysis project. In this case study, I perform real-world data analyst tasks using company data collected through web scraping to uncover key business insights. I use SQL (BigQuery) for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for data visualization. The analysis explores company revenue, growth rates, employee efficiency, and industry trends.
## Background
This dataset contains information on the top 100 largest companies in the United States, including details such as company name, industry, headquarters location, number of employees, revenue in USD, and revenue growth. The data was collected through web scraping and provides a snapshot of major U.S. corporations across various industries. The purpose of this project is to explore trends in company size, industry dominance, growth patterns, and revenue efficiency to generate insights.

## Analysis Questions
These questions guided my analysis and visualization process:
- Which industries dominate among the top 100 U.S. companies?
- Which states host the headquarters of the most high-revenue companies?
- Which companies generate the highest revenue overall?
- Are larger companies (with more employees) generating higher revenue or growing faster?
- Do smaller companies show faster revenue growth compared to large corporations?
- Which industries have the highest average revenue per company?
- What is the relationship between revenue size and revenue growth?
