Companies are grouped into 3 categories:
- Large (very high revenue)
- Medium
- Small (lower revenue)

The Y-axis shows their average revenue growth rate.

Bigger companies tend to grow faster than smaller ones.

### Do big employees related with revenue growth
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebcbff35-fc1a-4a11-b5bf-55bfde708e2b)
- Companies like Walmart and Amazon have millions of employees but low or moderate growth.
- Nvidia, with fewer employees, shows very high growth.
- Most companies are clustered near the bottom with lower growth and fewer employees.

Just because a company has many employees doesn’t mean it’s growing faster. In fact, smaller tech companies can grow much faster than the big companies.
