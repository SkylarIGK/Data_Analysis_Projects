# Hotel Booking Analysis
## Introduction
This is a Hotel Booking Data Analysis project. In this case study, I perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst using data of hotel bookings from Kaggle to uncover meaningful insights. I use the SQL for data analysis process to clean, analyze, and visualize the data using Power BI.
## Background
This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, including details such as booking dates, lead time, number of guests, booking status (canceled or not), and other features like special requests, market segment, and customer type. The purpose of this project is to uncover trends in booking behavior, cancellations, guest demographics, and other relevant metrics to support business decision-making.

## Business Task
Provide data-driven recommendations to help hotel stakeholders understand guest behaviors and improve booking outcomes, reduce cancellations, and optimize marketing strategies.
## Analysis Questions
These questions guided my analysis and visualization process:
What is the average lead time for bookings? Are people booking far in advance or last minute?
Which months have the highest number of bookings?
Do repeated guests cancel less often than new guests?
Which countries do most guests come from?
Which market segment brings in the most bookings?
Do bookings with long waiting lists cancel more often?
What are the relationships between children/babies and room types?
## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source: [Hotel Booking data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) (accessed on 11/04/2025)
Data was taken from Kaggle and contains booking records for two types of hotels. Each record represents a booking and includes customer details, booking status, and stay information.
### Data Organization
The dataset includes both numerical and categorical fields such as lead time, country, reserved room type, special requests, and customer type.
## Process
BigQuery was selected for data cleaning and exploration due to the large volume of data.
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing by using BigQuery.
### Data Cleaning
Big Query was used in data cleaning process too. Here is the link of all queries that I used in data exploration and data cleaning process. [SQL Queries](SQL-Queries.sql)
### Analyze and Share
I used Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
### Act
These are my recommendations based on my analysis insights. [Recommendation](Recommendation.md)
