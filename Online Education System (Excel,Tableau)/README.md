# Online Education System Analysis
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of online education during the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world student survey data. The objective of this analysis is to understand students’ learning experiences, performance, and satisfaction in an online education environment. Excel was used for data cleaning and standardization, while Tableau was used to design an interactive dashboard to visualize key patterns and insights. The analysis explores how factors such as age, gender, study habits, interaction with instructors, and access to resources influence students’ online learning outcomes.
## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted traditional education systems and forced a rapid transition from classroom-based learning to online education. Traditional classroom environments play an important role in students’ academic development and social interaction, and the sudden shift raised concerns regarding learning effectiveness, student engagement, and overall satisfaction.

This dataset was collected to analyze students’ experiences with online education and to evaluate their satisfaction and performance during this period. The data includes demographic information, study habits, access to technology, and self-reported academic performance both before and during online learning. With 23 columns and over 1,000 records, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of how different factors influence students’ online education experiences and outcomes.

## Analysis Questions
These questions guided my analysis and visualization process:
- What is the distribution of students by age group and gender?
- Does home location (urban vs. rural) affect access to internet facilities?
- What devices are most commonly used by students to attend online classes?
- How much time do students spend studying per day, and how does it vary by age group?
- Is there a relationship between study time and performance in online education?
- How does sleep duration affect students’ online learning performance?
- Does time spent on social media impact students’ performance or satisfaction with online education?
- Do students with a separate study room perform better in online education?
- Does family monitoring influence students’ study habits or performance?
- Does involvement in sports affect academic performance or satisfaction?
- How effective is online interaction with instructors across different age groups?
- Do students who engage in group studies perform better in online learning?
- Is better interaction with faculty associated with higher satisfaction in online education?
- Which factors most strongly influence overall student satisfaction with online education?
- Which age group performs best in online education?
## Prepare
### Data Source
Data Source : [Online Education System-Review data]([largest_companies_US.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaradha/online-education-system-review)) (accessed on 24/12/2025)
## Process
Excel was selected for data cleaning and exploration.
### Data Exploration
Before cleaning the data, I take the time to thoroughly understand the dataset that I will be analyzing by using Excel.
### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using Microsoft Excel to ensure data accuracy and consistency before analysis. The dataset was reviewed for formatting issues, incorrect data types, and inconsistent values. New derived columns were created. Formatting errors, including values incorrectly displayed as dates instead of text, were corrected. The cleaned and standardized dataset was then used for dashboard creation in Tableau.
### Analyze and Share
I used Tableau for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
