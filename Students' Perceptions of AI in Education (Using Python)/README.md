# Data Analysis with Python: Students' Perceptions of AI in Education
## Introduction
This is the Students' Perceptions of AI in Education data analysis. In this project, I will use Python for cleaning, analyzing, extracting insights and showcase my skills in Python that I have learned. I will analyze Students' Perceptions of AI in Education data from Kaggle to to explore interesting insights by using Python. 
## About Dataset and Background
This dataset contains the results of a survey conducted on undergraduate students enrolled in the 2nd and 3rd year of study at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Economic Informatics. The survey was conducted online and distributed through social media groups. The aim of the survey was to gather insights into students' perceptions of the role of artificial intelligence in education.

## Analysis Questions
These questions will guide my analysis: 
- How do students perceive the usefulness of AI in education, and what factors (such as gender, GPA, or exam performance) influence their views?
- Are there differences in AI awareness and attitudes between Year 2 and Year 3 students?
- What are the most common concerns students have about AI, and are these concerns linked to academic performance or field of study?
