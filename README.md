I’m assuming to be a junior data analyst on Bellabeat’s marketing team, I’m working with a company specializing in health-focused smart devices for women. Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, believes that analyzing data from our fitness devices can reveal valuable growth opportunities, helping Bellabeat expand its impact in the global market. I’ve been assigned to analyze data for one specific product, aiming to understand how customers are currently using our devices. My findings will support our marketing strategy and guide future growth. 
## Business Task
